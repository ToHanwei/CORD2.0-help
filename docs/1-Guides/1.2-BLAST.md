# 1.2 BLAST page

## Introduction

<p style="text-align:justify; line-height: 1.8; ">This page showcases the BLAST functionality developed based on the NCBI BLAST tool. It allows users to search for similar sequences in CORD, including protein and DNA sequences. For detailed information about BLAST and the construction of the CORD database, please <a href="#/./2-DataIntroduction/2.15-BLAST.md">refer to this link</a>.</p>

These are described in 3) below. Accepted input types are FASTA and bare sequence. Please note that only one sequence can be entered for BLAST at a time. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a notification. The entered sequence will undergo a validity check, and if any illegal characters are present, a warning message will be displayed.</p>

<span style="font-size:18px; color:red">④</span> Control panel for BLAST algorithm parameters

<p style="text-align:justify; line-height: 1.8; ">The algorithm parameters for "BLAST Proteins" and "BLAST Nucleotides" are not entirely consistent. It is important to note that in the "BLAST Nucleotides" functionality, we do not provide the "Scoring Matrix" parameter.</p>

* <p style="text-align:justify; line-height: 1.8; "><span style="font-size:16px; color:blue">ⓐ</span> Max Target Seqs: Select the maximum number of aligned sequences to display. Here, we provide several options: 10, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000. The default selection is 100.</p>
* <p style="text-align:justify; line-height: 1.8; "><span style="font-size:16px; color:blue">ⓑ</span> Word Size: The length of the seed that initiates an alignment. BLAST is a heuristic that works by finding word-matches between the query and database sequences. One may think of this process as finding “hot-spots” that BLAST can then use to initiate extensions that might eventually lead to full-blown alignments. For nucleotide-nucleotide searches (i.e., “blastn”) an exact match of the entire word is required before an extension is initiated, so that one normally regulates the sensitivity and speed of the search by increasing or decreasing the word-size. For other BLAST searches non-exact word matches are taken into accountbased upon the similarity between words. The amount of similarity can be varied. The webpage allows the word-sizes 2, 3, 5, and 6.</p>
* <p style="text-align:justify; line-height: 1.8; "><span style="font-size:16px; color:blue">ⓒ</span> Scoring Matrix: Assigns a score for aligning pairs of residues, and determines overall alignment score. We offer two series of scoring matrices: BLOSUM and PAM. In the BLOSUM series, we provide the following scoring matrices: BLOSUM45, BLOSUM45, BLOSUM50, BLOSUM80, and BLOSUM90. In the PAM series, we offer PAM30, PAM70, and PAM250. The default scoring matrix is BLOSUM62. For detailed information about the BLOSUM matrix, please <a href="#/./2-DataIntroduction/2.19-BLOSUMmatrix.md">refer to here</a>.</p>
* <p style="text-align:justify; line-height: 1.8; "><span style="font-size:16px; color:blue">ⓓ</span> Expect Threshold: This setting specifies the statistical significance threshold for reporting matches against database sequences. The default value (10) means that 10 such matches are expected to be found merely by chance, according to the stochastic model of Karlin and Altschul (1990). If the statistical significance ascribed to a match is greater than the EXPECT threshold, the match will not be reported. Lower EXPECT thresholds are more stringent, leading to fewer chance matches being reported.</p>
* <p style="text-align:justify; line-height: 1.8; "><span style="font-size:16px; color:blue">ⓔ</span> Restrict Taxonomy: Restrict search of database to include only the specified taxonomy ID(s). If there are multiple taxonomy IDs to input, please use a comma as the separator.</p>
