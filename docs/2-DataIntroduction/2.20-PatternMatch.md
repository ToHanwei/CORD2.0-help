# Pattern match

<p style="text-align:justify; line-height: 1.8; ">Given the notable conservation observed in the protein sequences of the olfactory receptor family, we have identified and defined 13 specific "motifs". These "motifs" serve as a benchmark for matching with newly annotated sequences, a process known as "pattern match". To quantify the matches, we further introduced the concept of "match score", which are calculated based on the degree of match between the sequence and each "patterns". Through "pattern match" and "match score", we are able to comprehensively evaluate the quality of newly annotated sequences, thereby ensuring the accuracy and reliability of research data.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; line-height: 1.8; ">In the "Motif" column, different symbols and characters are used to represent specific matching rules for amino acid sequences. Single letters, such as "C," indicate that the position can only match the corresponding amino acid—in this case, cysteine. Groups of letters enclosed in brackets, like "[YF]," mean that the position can match any amino acid listed within the brackets—in this example, either tyrosine or phenylalanine. The letter "x" is used to denote that the position can match any of the 20 natural amino acids. The notation "(n)" is used to indicate that there are n consecutive positions adopting the same matching rule. The "-" is used as a separator between positions or groups of positions, to clearly demarcate the boundaries between different sites or groups of sites.</p>

## Match score

The conversion relationship between "Match score" and "Pattern match."
