## Knowledge graph framework

<p style="text-align:justify; line-height: 1.8; ">The data foundation of CORD is built upon the Intelligent Biological Knowledge Graph developed by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ctyun.cn/">China Telecom Cloud Technology Co., Ltd.</a> This graph, based on the open-source graph database Nebula Graph, stores vast amounts of graphical network data, enabling comprehensive retrieval and analysis of graph information. The data organization is achieved through six fundamental data models for storage and retrieval, as outlined below:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; line-height: 1.5; text-indent: 2em"><b>1. Graph space (Space):</b> Graph Space is used to isolate data from different teams or projects. Data in different graph spaces is mutually isolated, allowing for the specification of different storage replication levels, permissions, sharding, etc.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; line-height: 1.5; text-indent: 2em"><b>2. Vertex (Point):</b> A vertex is used to store entity objects and is identified by a VID, which is unique within the same graph space.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; line-height: 1.5; text-indent: 2em"><b>3. Edge:</b> Edges connect vertices, representing relationships or actions between two points. An edge can be multi-edged between two points and has directionality. It is uniquely identified by a quadruple <Start VID, Edge type, Edge rank, End VID> (Rank can be used to differentiate edges with the same Edge type, start point, and end point. This value is entirely specified by the user.). An edge has only one Edge type.</Start>

<p style="text-align:justify; line-height: 1.5; text-indent: 2em"><b>4. Edge type:</b> Edge type is composed of a predefined set of attributes and serves as a concrete description of an edge. For example, the edge type from the node 'player' to 'team' can be defined as 'serve.'</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; line-height: 1.5; text-indent: 2em"><b>5. Property:</b> Properties are information represented in the form of key-value pairs and provide a set of descriptions for points or edges.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; line-height: 1.5; text-indent: 2em"><b>6. Tag:</b> A tag is composed of a predefined set of attributes and serves as a concrete description of a point. Each point can have multiple tags. For instance, a point with VID=01 can simultaneously have multiple tags, such as 'player' and 'singer.</p>
